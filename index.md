# Welcome to My Portfolio!

This site is a showcase of my work in network security, penetration testing, and ethical hacking. Here, you'll find projects, research notes, and hacking challenges that highlight my hands-on experience in cybersecurity.

I’ve built tools to monitor network traffic, deployed honeypots to track malicious activity, and conducted security audits to strengthen defenses. I also document my Hack The Box progress and CTF challenges, sharing insights along the way.

As I work toward my CPTS certification, this site will continue to grow with new projects and research. If you're a potential employer or fellow security enthusiast, take a look around—let’s connect! 

# About Me

I’m a freelance Python developer transitioning into cybersecurity, with a strong focus on network security, penetration testing, and threat detection. My background in software development has given me an understanding of how systems work—and how they can be broken.

My journey into cybersecurity started with a curiosity for ethical hacking and a drive to understand the techniques used by attackers. Since then, I’ve been hands-on with security research, Hack The Box challenges, and real-world security projects, constantly refining my skills.

My goal is to apply my knowledge to strengthen defenses, uncover vulnerabilities, and stay ahead of emerging threats.
