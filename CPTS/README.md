# CPTS Notes

I’m currently in the process of completing the Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) course, and I’m actively preparing for the exam. This page serves as a collection of my notes, insights, and key concepts learned during the course, and it will be continuously updated as I progress through the material.

## Current Status

I’m working through the course material and focusing on building hands-on experience with penetration testing tools, techniques, and methodologies. I aim to take the CPTS exam in the near future, applying the skills I’ve gained through real-world labs, HTB boxes, and exercises.
