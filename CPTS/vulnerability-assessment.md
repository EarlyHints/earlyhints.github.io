# Vulnerability Assessment

## Security assesment

### Pentesting

Black box - No information either given an internal port or just a company name.

Grey box - A little bit of knoledge like a receptionist etc. will have a user acount and normal priveledges

White box - Full access all configs and build docs and sourse codes

### Vulnerability assessments

Just scans for vulns does not actively exploit them

### Security audit

Is mandated by law and a third party will conduct this to make sure company is following all data privacy and security laws.

## Nessus

## Openvas

Same kind of thing as Nessus uses greenbone
